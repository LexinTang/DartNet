Note that WAITTIME for client is set to 10 seconds and WAITTIME for server is set to 15 seconds. You may wait a while for them to successfully quit.

Use the provided Makefile to build the code.  
There are two executables, a simple executable and a stress executable
for you to test with.
Just typing "make all‚Äù will make both the simple and stress executables.  
"make simple" will build just the simple
version and "make stress" will build just the stress version.
Use ./simple_client to run the simple client and ./simple_server
to run the simple server.  The stress versions can be run in the same way
with simple replaced with stress.
