# DartNet
A C based simplified TCP/IP network stack with implementation of the core transport and network layer protocols, including  
• Simple Reliable Transport protocol (SRT) that enables efficient data transfer through sliding window protocol and recovery from packet losses through go-back-n protocol.  
• Simple Network Protocol (SNP) that includes packet forwarding and routing through distance vector routing protocol.   
• Overlay Network (ON) that includes implementation of Internet routers on edge machines and network of overlay nodes based on routing graph.
